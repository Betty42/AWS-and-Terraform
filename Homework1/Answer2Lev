Taken from "AWS Identity and Access Management" user guide:

Using roles to grant permissions to applications that run on EC2 instances requires a bit of extra configuration.
An application running on an EC2 instance is abstracted from AWS by the virtualized operating system. Because of this extra separation, an additional step is needed to assign an AWS role and its associated permissions to an EC2 instance and make them available to its applications.
This extra step is the creation of an instance profile that is attached to the instance. The instance profile contains the role and can provide the role's temporary credentials to an application that runs on the instance. Those temporary credentials can then be used in the application's API calls to access resources and to limit access to only those resources that the role specifies.
